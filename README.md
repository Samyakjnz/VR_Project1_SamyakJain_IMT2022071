Face Mask Detection and Segmentation
1. Introduction
This project explores different techniques for detecting and segmenting face masks in images. It covers two main tasks: binary classification (to determine if a person is wearing a mask) and mask region segmentation. We employ both traditional machine learning approaches and deep learning models, including handcrafted feature extraction, CNN-based classification, and segmentation using U-Net. The goal is to compare the effectiveness of these methods in terms of accuracy and segmentation quality.
